# CPUSim

## Description

This project started out as a school-project and to be a drop-in replacement for the aging [sms32 Microprocessor Simulator](http://www.softwareforeducation.com/sms32v50/) but with some changes in mind.

### Differences (TODO: incomplete)

- No special "games" or traffic lights as outputs available
- many language differences (list?)
- custom (V)RAM size
- Breakpoints
- 16-bit
...

## Download

Binary releases together with the corresponding source code can be found in the [releases section](https://github.com/HERDER2014/CPUSim/releases) of our GitHub page.

### ArchLinux Users

There's already an (incomplete) [PKGBUILD available in the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/herder-cpusim-git/) ([upstream URL](https://github.com/LeonardKoenig/PKGBUILDs))

## Building & Contributing

### Dependencies

- lazarus
- qt4pas (linux?)
- lazarus-qt (?- lazarus-qt (?))

### Build

execute to build in release mode (optmizations such as O3 flags):

```
lazbuild --build-mode=release --widgetset=qt --build-all --recursive cpusim.lpi
```

skip the build-mode flag in order to build in debug mode.

To open the project in the Lazarus IDE just open the cpusim.lpi as a project.

### Packaging (Linux)

The icon [src/cpusim.png](src/cpusim.png) should be located at

`/usr/share/pixmaps/cpusim.png`

and the contents of the ['Examples' directory](Examples/) in

`/usr/share/cpusim/Examples/`

TODO: Use a scalable vektor graphics instead of png and fix paths in source code

The [desktop file](cpusim.desktop) should be ready to use and goes into

`/usr/share/applications/`

### Contribute

See the [git book](git-scm.com/book/en/v2) on how to use git.
Forks and pull requests welcome.

Please try avoiding to commiting lfm files when you did not a change (lazarus writes windows arrangement into lfm's which we don't want to commit).

## Roadmap

### Must-have:
- 16bit
- CPU Simulation
- Befehle von Niklas Zettel
- GUI
- Heftige Kommentierung
- Ein-/Ausgabe
- Speichern/Ã–ffnen

### Should have:
- Monitor
- Debugger

### Nice to have:
- Dokumentation
- String Operationen (kp mehr was das sein soll)
